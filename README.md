# web-design-challenge
This repo contains my html/css homework. The assignment was to track the weather of 500+ cities at different latitiudes relative to the equator. There are four different visualizations in this project: City Latitude vs. Max Temperature, City Latitude vs. Humidity, City Latitude vs. Cloudiness, and City Latitude vs. Wind Speed. Using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Pandas, I was able to show these visualizations through a GitHub Page that is attached below. In addition, the GitHub page contains a comparison page, which is another menu to select a visualization, and data section, which contains the data used for the project.
